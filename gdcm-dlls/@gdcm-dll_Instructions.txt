Any project that references these dlls will need them copied to the bin before compilation.

Manually copy this folder into the solution folder.

Reference gdcm-sharp.dll in the project.

Set the target platform to x64. These dlls are for windows x64. 32-bit would require a different set of dlls to be built...

In project properties for each referencing project, add the following pre-build event:
copy "$(SolutionDir)gdcm-dlls\*.dll" "$(TargetDir)*.dll"
